STRENGTHS: 
	This shell can execute a large number of pipes and handle a large amount of data very consistently. Thereâ€™s little to no memory leakage, and a decent amount functional decomposition.

WEAKNESSES:
	This program is pretty inefficient. If I had spent more time doing initial planning of the code, I could have dumped a lot of repeated code lines into separate functions, and kept the code shorter and cleaner as well. The comments are also not great, I neglected to put any in until the program was fully functional.
